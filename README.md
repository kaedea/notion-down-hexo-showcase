This repo is Hexo integration showcase for [NotionDown](https://github.com/kaedea/notion-down), 
by converting Notion pages from [notion post](https://www.notion.so/kaedea/Hexo-Integration-Post-01f2281aa8604215a3168ba063d72705) into Hexo source MD files located in `/hexo-blog/source/_posts`, 
and then generating Hexo public pages, 
finally publishing the pages into `/docs` as static blog pages.
