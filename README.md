This repo is Hexo integration showcase for [NotionDown](https://github.com/kaedea/notion-down). Check demo site at [hexo.kaedea.com](https://hexo.kaedea.com)

It works with following steps:
1. Converting Notion pages from [notion post](https://www.notion.so/kaedea/Hexo-Integration-Post-01f2281aa8604215a3168ba063d72705) into Hexo source MD files.
2. Placing the MD files into `/hexo-blog/source/_posts`.
3. Gnerating Hexo public pages.
4. Finally publishing the pages into `/docs` as static blog pages.
